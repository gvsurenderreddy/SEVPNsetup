A shell script to install VPN using SoftEther on Ubuntu VPS like DigitalOcean

## Execution

* Execution for installation and setup

```shell
sudo su
wget -O - go.cmru.info/se-vpnsetup| sh
```

This script installs SoftEtherVPN Server from a ppa repository
After SE-VPN is built, it setups the SE-VPN server.

The following are done:
* adds a VirtualHub named VPN
* adds a user to the hub VPN with the username vpn and password vpn
* Creates a tap device called soft for local bridging
* And bridges it to the hub VPN.
* The tap device is initialized with ip address of 172.16.0.1
 
DNSMasq is installed to provide DNS and DHCP to the VPN Clients

IP tables are configured to provide DDOS protection and port redirection:
* TCP ports: 80,443,5242,4244,3128,9200,9201,21,137,8484,82  to-port 995
* UDP Ports: 80,443,5242,4244,3128,9200,9201,21,137,8484,82,5243,9785,2000:4499,4501:8000  to-port 1194
* to allow SE-VPN clients to connect to the TCP ports
* and to allow OpenVPN clients to connect to both TCP and UDP ports

Lastly: It outputs a URL with the Sample OpenVPN config which can be modified to connect to various ports.

Then it prompts you to set a server password
